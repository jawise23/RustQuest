# 🧙‍♂️ RustQuest

**RustQuest** is an educational game that teaches programming fundamentals using Rust — through adventure, puzzles, and quests.

Inspired by classic adventure games, *RustQuest* lets players guide a character across a tile-based map, solving challenges by writing real Rust code.

---

## 🎯 Vision

Teach Rust (and core programming concepts) in a fun, story-driven way:

- 📜 Quests to solve using code.
- 🧩 Challenges that reinforce logic, control flow, and functions.
- 🧱 Tile-based maps with characters, objects, and actions.
- 🧠 Progressively unlocked abilities (conditionals, loops, pattern matching).

---
## 🛠️ Project Status

RustQuest is in **early** development. **Current focus:**
 - Setting up core project infrastructure
 - Building a world engine
 - Defining movement and action instructions
 - Designing a starter quest

---

## 🚀 Example Challenge

Players use built-in Rust functions to move a character around the map — such as moving forward, turning, or picking up objects. Each level introduces a new Rust concept through puzzles.

## 🧱 Built With

- 🦀 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- 📦 [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
- ⚙️ [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

---

## 🔁 Branching Strategy

RustQuest uses a 3-stage branching model:
- `dev`: Open development, frequent commits, relaxed rules
- `test`: Staging branch, CI-enforced, tested before merge to main
- `main`: Production-ready, protected, tagged releases

All branches run full CI checks with GitHub Actions on push and PRs.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Build foundational Rust understanding through **play**
- Help learners transition from block-based logic to writing real Rust code
- Allow **custom levels and quests** via open format
- Track learning progression with XP, levels, and badges

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Template CI/CD setup (done!)
- [ ] Design tile system and movement rules
- [ ] Build map format and sprite controller
- [ ] Build Rust command interpreter
